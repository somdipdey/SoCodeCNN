# SoCodeCNN
Main program code to convert Program Source Code in C language to SoCodeCNN Images, as explained in the paper, "SoCodeCNN: Program Source Code for Visual CNN Classification Using Computer Vision Methodology", published in IEEE Access (2019).

## Requirements
Please make sure that LLVM compiler is installed in your computer. More details on LLVM could be accessed from here: http://laure.gonnord.org/pro/research/ER03_2015/lab1_intro.pdf 

You would also require to install clang on your system. Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ programming languages, as well as the OpenMP, OpenCL, RenderScript and CUDA frameworks. It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure as its back end.
